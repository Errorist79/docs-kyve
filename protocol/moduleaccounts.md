# Module Accounts

Some modules have their own module account. Think of this as a wallet that can only be controlled by that module.
Below is a table of modules, their respective wallet addresses and permissions.

### Account Permissions and their meaning

The `burner` permission means this account has the permission to burn or destroy tokens.
The `minter` permission means this account has permission to mint or create new tokens.
The `staking` permission means this account has permission to stake tokens on behalf of its owner.

| Name | Address | Permissions |
